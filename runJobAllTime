### 🚀 AutoSys JIL to Run Jobs Every Hour (and More!)

If you're working with **AutoSys** and need to schedule jobs that run frequently—say every hour or every 30 minutes—this post is for you. ⏰

🔧 In one of my interviews, I was asked how to schedule a job to run every hour, every day using JIL. Here's how I solved it (plus some handy variations)!

### ✅ Run Every Hour (24x7)

```jil
insert_job: my_hourly_job
job_type: c
command: /path/to/your/script.sh
machine: your_machine_name
owner: your_user
permission: gx,wx
std_out_file: /tmp/my_hourly_job.out
std_err_file: /tmp/my_hourly_job.err
alarm_if_fail: 1
start_mins: 00
run_calendar: all_days
```

---

### ⏱ Run Every 30 Minutes

```jil
start_mins: 00,30
```

---

### 📅 Run Every Hour But Only Weekdays

```jil
run_calendar: weekday_calendar
```
(Assuming `weekday_calendar` excludes weekends)

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip

If you're using a **box job**, make sure the box is set to `box_terminator: 1` and is scheduled correctly. Otherwise, the command job inside might not run on each interval.

---

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Use `start_mins` for fine-grained control over job timings. Combine it with `run_calendar` to make your schedule smarter!
